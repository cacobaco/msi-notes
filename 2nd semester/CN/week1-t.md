# Week 1 Theory

## Cloud Overview

### Cloud
Unlike VPS, cloud services allow for scalable resource allocation and adjustments as needed.

- Resources can be limited per project/user.
- IT resources include:
    - Compute
    - Storage
    - Network
    - Database
    - Services

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing resources over the internet.

- Pay-per-use model, similar to utility bills (electricity/water).

### Cloud Provider
A company that owns and manages the physical resources for cloud computing.

### Key Characteristics
- Broad network access
- Rapid elasticity (dynamic scaling based on demand)
- Measured services (pay-as-you-go model)
- On-demand self-services
- Resource pooling
- Multitenancy

**Scalability vs Elasticity**: Elasticity involves automatic, dynamic scaling during high traffic periods.

### Examples of Cloud Computing
- Scalable utilization
- Chatbots (e.g., Siri)
- Messaging and calling apps (e.g., WhatsApp)
- Productivity tools (e.g., Microsoft Office 365)
- Business process management (e.g., Salesforce)
- Backup and recovery (e.g., Backblaze)
- Application development (e.g., Amazon Lumberyard)
- Testing and development (e.g., LoadStorm)
- Big data analytics (e.g., Google BigQuery)
- Social networking (e.g., LinkedIn)

## Web APIs

### Web Service
**Definition pending.**

### Interservice Communication
- Request/Response
- Event-driven messaging

### Remote Procedure Call (gRPC)
- The "g" stands for Google.
- gRPC is faster than REST.
- Commonly used for communication between microservices.
